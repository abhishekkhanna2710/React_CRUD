### The Experience of Project

This task has name, email, phone, date of birth (dob), gender, and hobbies fields are all part of this assignment, which is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) activity for an Employee. The dob field is a date picker, whereas the name, email, and phone fields are input boxes. The hobbies area has a set of checkboxes, while the gender field has a set of radio buttons.
In this project, the form is built using Material UI Form Controls, the data is displayed using a Data Table, and the employees are added and edited using Modals. The project also incorporates a bogus backend server called JSON server.
