### `About the Assignment`

This assignment is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operation for an Employee with six fields: 
name, email, phone, date of birth (dob), gender, and hobbies. The name, email, and phone fields are input boxes,
while the dob field is a date picker. The gender field is a set of radio buttons, and the hobbies field is a set of checkboxes.

This project uses Material UI Form Controls to build the form, a Data Table to display data, and Modals to add and edit employees. 
Additionally, the project integrates with a fake backend server.

The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly interface for managing employee data that allows users to add, edit, and delete employees. 
This project aims to provide a clean and modern interface that is easy to use and understand.
